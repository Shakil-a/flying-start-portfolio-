    <h2>My hobbies</h2>
    <p>im also interested in the financial markets, watching my favourite team manchester united play even though they often leave me 
      dissapointed, learning about historical figures of the past and how they influenced people of their time and weight lifting 
      consistently in the gym which actually helps my mental health (often stress) more than my physical health nowadays.
