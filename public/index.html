      <h2>An interesting fact</h2>
      <p> i enjoy trading the forex markets which is pretty unusual as i lose more trades than i win, The more important 
        thing is that in my journey one of the mentors who ive learnt off holds a software engineering degree and creates software applications 
        and a trading robot for the markets, he is one of the reasons why i looked into software engineering     </p>

      <h2>My hobbies</h2>
      <p>im also interested in the financial markets, watching my favourite team manchester united play even though they often leave me 
        dissapointed, learning about historical figures of the past and how they influenced people of their time and weight lifting 
        consistently in the gym which actually helps my mental health (often stress) more than my physical health nowadays.
